# Animal Nursery by sulazula 🥇

## Welcome! 🐶🐴

Welcome to the Animal Nursery project! I made this application as an exam :) This application allows you to manage a collection of animals, including adding new animals, training them with commands, and saving/loading their state using JSON.

- **Add New Animals**: Introduce new animals into the system, whether they are Packs or Pets.
- **Assign Commands**: Teach animals new commands and keep track of what commands they can perform.
- **Check Commands**: View the list of commands that an animal can perform.
- **Save and Load Data**: Persist animal data and commands to a JSON file, and reload them when needed.

### Features ⭐

- **Add Animals**: Input details such as name, age, and subclass of the animal.
- **Assign Commands**: Add commands to each animal and manage them easily.
- **View Commands**: Check what commands each animal can perform.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load animal data and their associated commands using JSON.
